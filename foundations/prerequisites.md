# Prerequisites

A real understanding of machine learning 
and neural networks requires logical thinking 
and solid mathematical foundations. 
Math is the language of all scientific knowledge. 
Without it, you're limited to superficial use and 
intuition.

This section covers the minimum mathematical 
background needed to follow learning paths in 
this repository.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Linear Algebra

Understanding vectors, 
matrices, 
and their transformations is essential for everything 
from data representation to backpropagation.

Recommended:
- [3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)  
  A visual explanation of core topics like linear transformations, matrix multiplication, and basis changes.

### 2. Calculus

Key for understanding optimization, 
loss functions, 
and how learning actually happens through gradients.

Recommended:
- [3Blue1Brown: Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)  
  Covers derivatives, chain rule, and the intuition behind how functions change.

### 3. Probability & Statistics

Required for evaluating models, 
understanding distributions, 
and reasoning under uncertainty.

Topics to know:
- Probability basics (independence, conditional probability, Bayes rule)
- Distributions (normal, Bernoulli, binomial)
- Mean, variance, standard deviation
- Sampling, confidence intervals
- Correlation vs. causation

Recommended:
- [Khan Academy: Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)

At the very least, watch the video series to refresh key concepts. Use pen and paper as you go, 
writing things out helps build actual understanding.
