# Getting Started in Machine Learning

Make sure you are comfortable with the core prerequisites.

See: [prerequisites.md](./prerequisites.md).

## Recommended First Resource

Start with Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)
* one of the best introductions to machine learning
* ~~still~~ especially relevant today
* accessible yet rigorous

## Key Concepts to Know

You ought to become familiar with the following terms. These are part of the basic vocabulary ~~of machine learning~~:

* Training, Validation, and Testing datasets
* Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning
* Overfitting and Underfitting
* Cross-validation, k-fold cross-validation, stratified sampling, data leakage
* Performance metrics: Accuracy, F1 score, Precision vs. Recall, Weighted metrics
* Bias-variance tradeoff
