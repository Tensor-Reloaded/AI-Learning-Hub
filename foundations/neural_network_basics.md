# Neural Network Basics

Make sure you understand linear algebra and derivatives (see [prerequisites.md](./prerequisites.md)).

### Structured Learning with [Dive into Deep Learning (D2L)](https://d2l.ai/index.html)

We recommend following these chapters in order:
* Chapter 1. Introduction: https://d2l.ai/chapter_introduction/index.html
* Chapter 2. Preliminaries: https://d2l.ai/chapter_preliminaries/index.html
* Chapter 3. Linear Neural Networks for Regression: https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-regression/index.html
* Chapter 4. Linear Neural Networks for Classification: https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-classification/index.html
* Chapter 5. Multilayer Perceptrons: https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/index.html

> The remaining chapters go deeper into advanced architectures and training techniques. Return to them once you've built a solid foundation.
> 
> Alternatively, you may use https://course.fast.ai/.

## Understanding Backpropagation

* [Michael Nielsen, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, chapter 2](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) - 
Helps build a conceptual understanding.
* [Stanford CS231, Backpropagation, Intuitions](https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/) - 
Precise and rigorous. Useful for understanding how gradients are computed.
