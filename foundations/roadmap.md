# Learning Roadmap

Choose your path based on your goals and level of interest.

## Just Want to Use GenAI?

Not interested in understanding? Just want to use the tools?

Skip the theory:
- [GenAI Practical Usage](../genai_practical/)

## Interested Learners

If you want to understand what you're doing and go beyond using tools:

1. **[Prerequisites](./prerequisites.md)** - Build the necessary foundation.
2. **[Getting Started in ML](./how_to_start_ml.md)** - Introductory concepts and applications.
3. **[Neural Network Basics](./neural_network_basics.md)** - Backpropagation, training, and core intuition.
4. **[PyTorch](../resources/beginner_pytorch)** - Hands-on experimentation.

## Advanced Learners

For those with foundational knowledge, use the resources below to deepen your expertise:
- [Papers collection](../resources/nice_papers.md) - Curated foundational and topic-specific research
- [Recommended books](../resources/books.md) - Established references for deep learning and ML theory
- [Advanced PyTorch](../resources/advanced_pytorch) â€“ Performance tips, C++ extensions, custom backprop, dataloading
- [Computer Vision (CV)](../resources/CV/) - CNNs, object detection, Vision Transformers  
- [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](../resources/NLP/) - Classical NLP, Transformers, LLMs  
<!-- - [MLOps](../resources/mlops.md) - Experiment tracking, versioning, deployment 
-->
